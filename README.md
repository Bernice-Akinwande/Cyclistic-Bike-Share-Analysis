## by Bernice Akinwande


## Dataset

> Cyclistic bike-share company wants to explore how different customers uses cyclistic bikes, get insights from their previous data and make recommendations to build strategies that would convert casual riders to casual members.

> This analysis will cover the 6 data analyst phases; ask (asking relevant questions), prepare (collect, organize and store data), process (eliminate inaccuracies that can get in the way of the results), analyzing (using R as a tool to transform and organize the information so I can draw useful conclusions, act (put insights to work)


## Summary of Findings and Recommendation

> On a average, members take more rides than casual riders, they have the biggest portion of the total rides; so, to compel casual riders to opt in for membership subscription, discounts could be given out to casual riders thatâ€™d like to switch to become members, followed by a flexible payment plan

> Riders tend to use more docked bikes; hence, funds should be directed to acquiring more docked bikes and maybe implementing the catchy features on docked bikes to the others so that riders can have alternatives if docked bikes run out of rentage.

> Marketing strategies like campaigns can be done via advertisement to state the benefits of membership, this will compel riders to opt into the membership subscription.
